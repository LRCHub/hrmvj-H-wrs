[00:03.51] I was supposed to be sent away
[00:06.89] But they forgot to come and get me
[00:13.22] I was a functioning alcoholic
[00:16.34] 'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
[00:24.07] All of this to say, I hope you're okay
[00:28.26] But you're the reason
[00:33.83] And no one here's to blame
[00:37.43] But what about your quiet treason?
[00:54.43] 
[00:41.88] And for a fortnight there, we were forever running
[00:46.50] Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
[00:51.31] Now you're in my backyard turned into good neighbors
[00:56.44] Your wife waters flowers, I want to kill her
[01:18.44] 
[01:03.47] All my mornings are Monday stuck in an endless February
[01:13.07] I took the miracle move-on drug
[01:16.89] The effects were temporary
[01:21.72] And I love you, it's ruining my life
[01:27.19] I love you, its ruining my life
[01:32.29] I touched you for only a fortnight
[01:37.27] I touched you, but I touched you
[01:53.27] 
[01:41.74] And for a fortnight there, we were forever running
[01:46.93] Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
[01:51.44] Now you're in my backyard turned into good neighbors
[01:56.57] Your wife waters flowers, I want to kill her
[02:18.57] 
[02:01.65] And for a fortnight there, we were together running
[02:06.90] Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
[02:11.49] Now you're at the mailbox turned into good neighbors
[02:16.53] My husband is cheating, I want to kill him
[02:37.53] 
[02:22.26] I love you, it's ruining my life
[02:27.01] I love you, it's ruining my life
[02:32.28] I touched you for only a fortnight
[02:37.09] I touched you, I touched you
[02:42.11] I love you, it's ruining my life
[02:47.07] I love you, it's ruining my life
[02:52.11] I touched you for only a fortnight
[02:57.16] I touched you, I touched you
[03:11.16] 
[03:01.84] Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
[03:06.65] Another fortnight lost in America
[03:11.87] Move to Florida, buy the car you want
[03:16.77] But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
[03:43.27] 
[03:22.14] I call you up, but you won't pick up
[03:26.77] Another fortnight lost in America
[03:31.67] Move to Florida, buy the car you want
[03:36.79] But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you
