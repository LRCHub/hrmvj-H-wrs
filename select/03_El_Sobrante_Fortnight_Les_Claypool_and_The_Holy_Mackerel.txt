Brimming with all the hopes and desires of American
Youth, he set forth as a leader of sorts. Just what
Sorts it is impossiblew to say at this time. But he had
The imaginary support he needed to venture beyond
The small environment he'd come to know as his
Home town.

Friends thought him foolish and felt free to fre-
Quently tell him so. Deep down they all felt envy.
Envious that he could muster, where they could not,
The courage that was necessary to embark beyond
The notion that survival was based upon the ability
To rise at seven a.m. five days a week.

He felt joy. And well he should. He was a "babe in
The woods" and a "kid in a candy store" all at the
Same time. The world was his oyster and he planned
To shuck it, cover it with Tabasco, and slurp it down
His cake hole all within an "El Sobrante fortnight".

Definition of an "El Sobrante fortnight" is yet to be
Determined. But reliable sources say the time span is
Somewhere between two weeks and a decade.
